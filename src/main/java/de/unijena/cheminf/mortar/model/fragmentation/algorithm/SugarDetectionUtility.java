/**
 * Utility class for detecting and extracting sugar moieties from molecular structures.
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@link SugarRemovalUtility} to provide functionality for separating
 * glycosides into their aglycone and sugar components.
 * The main feature is the ability to create copies of both the aglycone (non-sugar backbone)
 * and individual sugar fragments from a given molecule, with proper handling of attachment
 * points and stereochemistry.
 *
 * <p>The extraction process supports:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Detection and extraction of both circular and linear sugar moieties</li>
 *   <li>Preservation of stereochemistry at connection points</li>
 *   <li>Proper saturation of broken bonds with either R-groups or implicit hydrogens</li>
 *   <li>Post-processing of sugar fragments including bond splitting (O-glycosidic, ether, ester, peroxide)</li>
 *   <li>Handling of connecting heteroatoms (oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur) in glycosidic bonds</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All sugar detection and removal operations respect the settings inherited from the
 * parent {@link SugarRemovalUtility} class, including terminal vs. non-terminal sugar
 * removal, preservation mode settings, and various detection thresholds.
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * SugarDetectionUtility utility = new SugarDetectionUtility(SilentChemObjectBuilder.getInstance());
 * List<IAtomContainer> fragments = utility.copyAndExtractAglyconeAndSugars(molecule);
 * IAtomContainer aglycone = fragments.get(0);  // First element is always the aglycone
 * // Subsequent elements are individual sugar fragments
 * }</pre>

    /**
     * Extracts copies of the aglycone and (specified) sugar parts of the given molecule (if there are any).
     * <p>
     * This method creates a deep copy of the input molecule and removes the specified
     * sugar moieties (circular and/or linear) to produce an aglycone. It then creates
     * a second copy to extract the sugar fragments that were removed. The attachment
     * points between the aglycone and sugars are handled by either adding R-groups
     * (pseudo atoms) or implicit hydrogens to saturate the broken bonds.
     *
     * <p>The method preserves stereochemistry information at connection points and
     * handles glycosidic bonds appropriately. When bonds are broken between sugar
     * moieties and the aglycone, connecting heteroatoms (such as glycosidic oxygen,
     * nitrogen, or sulfur atoms) are copied to both the aglycone and sugar fragments
     * to maintain chemical validity.
     *
     * <p>The extraction process respects all current sugar detection settings as described in
     * {@link SugarRemovalUtility}, including terminal vs. non-terminal sugar removal,
     * preservation mode settings, and various detection thresholds.
     *
     * <p>Note that atom types are not copied, they have to be re-perceived if needed.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method additionally gives you the option to supply four maps as parameters that will be filled with a
     * mapping of atoms and bonds in the original molecule to the atoms and bonds in the aglycone and sugar copies. They
     * should be of sufficient size and empty when given.</p>
     *
     * @param mol The input molecule to separate into aglycone and sugar components.
     *            Must not be null but can be empty; a list containing only the empty given
     *            atom container is returned in the latter case.
     * @param extractCircularSugars If true, circular sugar moieties will be detected
     *                             and extracted according to current settings.
     * @param extractLinearSugars If true, linear sugar moieties will be detected
     *                           and extracted according to current settings.
     * @param markAttachPointsByR If true, attachment points where sugars and the aglycone were connected
     *                           are marked with R-groups (pseudo atoms). If false,
     *                           implicit hydrogens are added to saturate the connections.
     * @param postProcessSugars If true, postprocessing of sugar fragments is performed, i.e. splitting O-glycosidic
     *                          bonds in circular and splitting ether, ester, and peroxide bonds in linear sugar moieties
     * @param limitPostProcessingBySize If true, sugar moieties will only be separated/split in postprocessing if they are larger
     *                                  than the set preservation mode threshold (see {@link SugarRemovalUtility}). This is
     *                                  to prevent smaller substituents like, e.g. methyl ethers, being separated from the
     *                                  sugars. For linear sugars, the minimum size for linear sugar candidates is applied
     *                                  as a criterion.
     * @param inputAtomToAtomCopyInAglyconeMap Map to be filled with mappings from original atoms to their copies in the aglycone.
     *                                         Can be null (a new map will be created) or an empty map with sufficient capacity.
     * @param inputBondToBondCopyInAglyconeMap Map to be filled with mappings from original bonds to their copies in the aglycone.
     *                                         Can be null (a new map will be created) or an empty map with sufficient capacity.
     * @param inputAtomToAtomCopyInSugarsMap Map to be filled with mappings from original atoms to their copies in the sugar fragments.
     *                                       Can be null (a new map will be created) or an empty map with sufficient capacity.
     * @param inputBondToBondCopyInSugarsMap Map to be filled with mappings from original bonds to their copies in the sugar fragments.
     *                                       Can be null (a new map will be created) or an empty map with sufficient capacity.
     * @return A list of atom containers where the first element is the aglycone
     *         (copy molecule with sugars removed) and subsequent elements are the
     *         individual sugar fragments that were extracted (also copies). If no sugars were
     *         detected or removed, returns a list containing only a copy of the
     *         original molecule. Sugar fragments may be disconnected from each
     *         other if they were not directly linked in the original structure or were disconnected in postprocessing.
