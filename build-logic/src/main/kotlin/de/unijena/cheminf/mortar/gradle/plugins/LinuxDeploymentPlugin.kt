/**
 * Gradle plugin for Linux deployment using jpackage.
 *
 * This plugin registers tasks for creating Linux deployment packages in DEB and RPM formats.
 * It applies Gradle best practices, such as lazy task registration and minimal configuration,
 * for better performance and compatibility with the configuration cache.
 *
 * Registered Tasks:
 * - `localLinuxDeb`: Creates a Debian package. Depends on the `fatJar` task.
 * - `localLinuxRpm`: Creates a Red Hat package. Depends on the `fatJar` task.
 *
 * Task Configuration:
 * - The `LocalLinuxDeploy` task type is used for the packaging process.
 * - Caching is disabled for these tasks due to their external nature.
 *
 * Preconditions for Task Execution:
 * - The operating system must be Linux.
 * - A valid installation of `jpackage` must be accessible on the system PATH (provided by JDK 14+).
 * - The required fat jar must be pre-built.
 * - An application icon file in the expected format must be available.
 *
 * This plugin is part of a series of deployment plugins in the MORTAR framework, designed for various platforms including macOS and Windows.
